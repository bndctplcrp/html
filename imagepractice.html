            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single
            sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
            Length and appearance do not determine whether a section 
            in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of
            writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph 
            can be just one sentence long.
